day 7
-----

On [day 6][day6] we compared Scala's `for` comprehension with Haskell's `do`,
and implemented the `actM` macro.
We also looked at the `Reader` datatype, which is another way of thinking about `Function1[A, B]`.

I had been a bit sloppy by describing `List` and `Reader` as monads,
but I want to correctly say `List` datatype and `Reader` datatype,
which form a monad under some operation.
