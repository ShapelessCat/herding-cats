day 17
------

On [day 16][day16] we looked at some concrete categories using Awodey's 'Category Theory' as the guide.

We can now talk about abstract structures today. A definition or a theorem is called *abstract*, when it relies only on category theoric notions, rather than some additional information about the objects and arrows. The definition of isomorphism is one such example:

> **Definition 1.3** In any category **C**, an arrow *f: A => B* is called an *isomorphism*, if there is an arrow g: B => A in **C** such that:
>
> *g ∘ f = 1<sub>A</sub>* and *f ∘ g = 1<sub>B</sub>*.

We can use this notion of isomorphism as a building block to explore more concepts.
