### Duality

#### Opposite category

Before we get into duality, we need to cover the concept of generating a category out of an existing one. Note that we are no longer talking about objects, but a category, which includes objects and arrows.

> The opposite (or "dual") category **C<sup>op</sup>** of a category **C** has the same objects as **C**, and an arrow f: C => D in **C<sup>op</sup>** is an arrow f: D => C in **C**. That is, **C<sup>op</sup>** is just **C** with all of the arrows formally turned around.

#### The duality principle

If we take the concept further, we can come up with "dual statement" _Σ<sup>*</sup>_ by substituting any sentence Σ in the category theory by replacing the following:

- *f ∘ g* for *g ∘ f*
- codomain for domain
- domain for codomain

Since there's nothing semantically important about which side is *f* or *g*, the dual statement also holds true as long as Σ only relies on category theory. In other words, any proof that holds for one concept also holds for its dual. This is called the *duality principle*.

Another way of looking at it is that if Σ holds in all **C**, it should also hold in **C<sup>op</sup>**, and so _Σ<sup>*</sup>_ should hold in **(C<sup>op</sup>)<sup>op</sup>**, which is **C**.

Let's look at the definitions of *initial* and *terminal* again:

> **Definition 2.9.** In any category **C**, an object
>
> - 0 is *initial* if for any object *C* there is a unique morphism<br> 0 => C
> - 1 is *terminal* if for any object *C* there is a unique morphism<br> C => 1

They are dual to each other, so the initials in **C** are terminals in **C<sup>op</sup>**.

Recall proof for "the initial objects are unique up to isomorphism."<br> ![initial objects](files/day17-initial-object-proof.png)

If you flip the direction of all arrows in the above diagram, you do get a proof for terminals.<br> ![terminal objects](files/day17-terminal-object-proof.png)

This is pretty cool.
