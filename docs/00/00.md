This is a web log of me learning Cats, based a log of me learning Scalaz.
It's sometimes called a tutorial, but you should treat it more like
a travel log that was scribbled together.
If you want to learn the stuff, I suggest you read books and go through the examples yourself.

Before we dive into the details, here is a prequel to ease you in.

### Intro to Cats

I'm going to borrow material from Nick Partridge's [Scalaz talk](http://vimeo.com/10482466) given at Melbourne Scala Users Group on March 22, 2010:

Cats consists of two parts:

1. New datatypes (`Validated`, `State`, etc)
2. Implementation of many general functions you need (ad-hoc polymorphism, traits + implicits)
