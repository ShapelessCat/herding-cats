[Yesterday][day4] we reviewed `Semigroup` and `Monoid`, implementing custom monoids along the way. We also looked at `Foldable` that can `foldMap` etc.

#### Apply.ap

Starting with a few updates today. First, `Apply.apply` that we looked at in day 3 has been renamed to `Apply.ap` [#308][308].

#### Serializable typeclass instance

Second, do you remember that checking the monoid laws on a value class kept tripping on `Serializable`?
That turned out not to be Cats' fault. I went into Cats' [gitter chat][gitter] and
Erik ([@d6][@d6]/[@non][@non]) kindly pointed out that the reason my typeclass instances are not serializable is because they are defined on the REPL. Once I moved `First` to `src/` the laws passed fine:

```scala
scala> import cats._, cats.std.all._
import cats._
import cats.std.all._

scala> import algebra.laws.GroupLaws
import algebra.laws.GroupLaws

scala> import org.scalacheck.{ Arbitrary, Gen }
import org.scalacheck.{Arbitrary, Gen}

scala> import example.First
import example.First

scala> implicit def arbFirst[A: Eq](implicit ev: Arbitrary[Option[A]]): Arbitrary[First[A]] =
     |          Arbitrary { ev.arbitrary map { First(_) } }
arbFirst: [A](implicit evidence\$1: cats.Eq[A], implicit ev: org.scalacheck.Arbitrary[Option[A]])org.scalacheck.Arbitrary[example.First[A]]

scala> val rs = GroupLaws[First[Int]].monoid
rs: algebra.laws.GroupLaws[example.First[Int]]#GroupProperties = algebra.laws.GroupLaws\$GroupProperties@77fac6ab

scala> rs.all.check
+ monoid.associativity: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.combineAll(Nil) == id: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.combineN(a, 0) == id: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.combineN(a, 1) == a: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.combineN(a, 2) == a |+| a: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.isEmpty: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.leftIdentity: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.rightIdentity: OK, passed 100 tests.
+ monoid.serializable: OK, proved property.
```

Jason Zaugg ([@retronym][@retronym]) also pointed that, to support serialization
beyond precisely the same version of Cats on both sides of the wire,
we need to do more things like:

- Avoid anonymous classes (to avoid class name change)
- Tack `@SerialVersionUID(0L)` on everything
