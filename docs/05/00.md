[Yesterday][day4] we reviewed `Semigroup` and `Monoid`, implementing custom monoids along the way. We also looked at `Foldable` that can `foldMap` etc.

#### Apply.ap

Starting with a few updates today. First, `Apply.apply` that we looked at in day 3 has been renamed to `Apply.ap` [#308][308].

#### Serializable typeclass instance

In a previous version, checking the monoid laws on a value class kept tripping on `Serializable`.
That turned out not to be Cats' fault. I went into Cats' [gitter chat][gitter] and
Erik ([@d6][@d6]/[@non][@non]) kindly pointed out that the reason my typeclass instances are not serializable is because they are defined on the REPL. Once I moved `First` to `src/` the laws passed fine.

Jason Zaugg ([@retronym][@retronym]) also pointed that, to support serialization
beyond precisely the same version of Cats on both sides of the wire,
we need to do more things like:

- Avoid anonymous classes (to avoid class name change)
- Tack `@SerialVersionUID(0L)` on everything
