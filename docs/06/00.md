day 6
-----

[Yesterday][day5] we looked at `FlatMap` and `Monad` typeclass. We looked at how monadic chaining can add contexts to values. Because both `Option` and `List` already have `flatMap` in the standard library, it was more about changing the way we see things rather than introducing new code. We also reviewed `for` syntax as a way of chaining monadic operations.

Before I jump into the topic, I want to mention [Pamflet][Pamflet], the Scala-based blog/book platform I'm using here.
Nathan Hamblen ([@n8han][@n8han]) started Pamflet and I've been contributing features to it too.
Speaking of which, the source of these posts are also available on [eed3si9n/herding-cats][repo]
if you're curious how this is built.
A special thanks to Leif Wickland ([@leifwickland][@leifwickland]) for proofreading all of the posts
and sending me pull requests with fixes!
