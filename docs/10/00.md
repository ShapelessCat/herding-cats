day 10
------

On [day 9][day9] we reviewed monadic functions `flatten`, `filterM`, and the implementation of `foldM`. Next we made a safe RPN calculator using `foldM`, looked at `Kleisli` composition, implemented our own monad `Prob`, and thought about fractals.

Since Cats does not provide Zippers, we are now done with Learn You a Haskell for Great Good, and we need to find our own topic.
