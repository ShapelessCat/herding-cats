herding cats
============

This is a log of me going through Cats, a functional programming library for Scala
that is currently *experimental* and under active development.
I'll try to follow the structure of [learning Scalaz][lsz] that I wrote in 2012 (!).

Cats [website][cats] says the name is a playful shortening of the word category.
They say coordinating programmers are like herding cats, and it seems to be true
at least for those of us using Scala. Keenly aware of this situation, cats list
approachability as its first motivation.

Cats also looks interesting from the technical perspective.
With its approachability and Erik Asheim ([@d6][@d6]/[@non][@non])'s awesomeness,
people are gathering around it with new ideas such as
Michael Pilquist ([@mpilquist][@mpilquist])'s [simulacrum][simulacrum] and
Miles Sabin ([@milessabin][@milessabin])'s deriving typeclasses.
Hopefully I'll learn more in the coming days.
