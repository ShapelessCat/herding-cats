day 12
------

On [day 11][day11] we started reading Jeremy Gibbons's
[Datatype-Generic Programming][Gibbons2006].
We saw the creative use of `Fix` and `Bifunctor`,

When we moved on to [The Essence of the Iterator Pattern][iterator2009],
we found that Cats uses `Const` to represent
monoidal applicatives like `Int`, but it's currently missing
a way to compose applicative functions.

We started with a custon datatype called `Prod`
that represents a pair of `F[A]` and `G[A]`,
then we also added `AppFunc` that represents applicative functions.
